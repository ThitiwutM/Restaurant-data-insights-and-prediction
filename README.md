# Restaurant-data-insights-and-prediction

This is a term project for the DS512/513/514/515 Data Analytics and Data Science course at SWU, Thailand.

The project aims to explore insights from restaurant sales data and identify the key factors influencing sales volume. In addition, we developed predictive models for quantity sold using linear regression and regularized linear regression techniques (Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net) to support restaurants in improving their performance and developing effective strategies to enhance sales.

The process includes data type checking, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization and dashboard creation, feature selection, data pre-processing before modeling, data pipeline development, model building, and model evaluation.
